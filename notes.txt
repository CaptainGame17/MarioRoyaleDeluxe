MARIO ROYALE DELUXE BETA TEST // 12-24-2022 -> 01-01-2023

Feedback: Positive
Bugs: Few, but exist. Documented later.
Activity: High on first day, but very low the next
Retention: 30 minutes up to 2 hours
Community Opinion: Good beta, bugs can be worked out.

Bugs Found:
- Horizontal warp pipe directions warp you at a wrong position or something

Features to add:
- Accounts and things locked under accounts: leaderboards, chat(?), some sort of shop
- Carrying shells, sprites already exist for these but it's hard to add them.
- Blending modes like grain merge for the water level effect.
- Dev kit; basically the console and tools for moderation.
- Backport custom textures, though make an easier way to manage them, give them names for example.

Important:
There should be more incentive to play the game. It's fun but currently there's nothing to really work towards and since player
counts are as low as they are, you're stuck for a while just playing alone or, if we're lucky then 2-3 people. Stuff has been
suggested like the hammer suit, PVP mario kart items, etc.
