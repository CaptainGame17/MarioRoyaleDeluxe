MARIO ROYALE DELUXE BETA TEST // 12-24-2022 -> 01-01-2023

Feedback: Positive
Bugs: Few, but exist. Documented later.
Activity: High on first day, but very low the next
Retention: 30 minutes up to 2 hours
Community Opinion: Good beta, bugs can be worked out.

Bugs Found:
- Max players in lobby is actually 30, but game says 75. - Fixed - Found in code -
- Vines use wrong sprite. Found in lobby and in-game. - Fixed -
- Lobby seems to rarely start. - Fixed - 15 second delay existed before the lobby would actually start. -
- Fire bro sprite uses hammer bro sprite as head. - Fixed - Not apparent normally but with mods it's easily seeable. -
- Funky invisible block collision. Can make you warp outside the map. - Fixed - 6-2 is an easy example. -
- Projectiles, cheep cheeps & podoboos are fast and sometimes unavoidable. - NOT Fixed - See 2-3 for examples -

Features to add:
- Accounts and things locked under accounts: leaderboards, chat(?), some sort of shop
- Carrying shells, sprites already exist for these but it's hard to add them.
- Animated backgrounds since basically every level uses them.
- Delete serbia
- Blending modes like grain merge for the water level effect.
- Dev kit; basically the console and tools for moderation.
- Backport custom textures, though make an easier way to manage them, give them names for example.
- Some objects from Legacy. Most notably Object Spawner (id 25 i think)

Important:
There should be more incentive to play the game. It's fun but currently there's nothing to really work towards and since player
counts are as low as they are, you're stuck for a while just playing alone or, if we're lucky then 2-3 people. Stuff has been
suggested like the hammer suit, PVP mario kart items, etc.
